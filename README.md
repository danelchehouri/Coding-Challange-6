# Coding-Challange-6

Within the boundaries of an HTML canvas element, we are constructing an interactive animation of a ball bouncing. JavaScript and HTML5 will be used to implement the animation; the canvas API will be used for drawing, and JavaScript intervals will be used for smooth animations. The canvas must be set up, a ball object must be created with properties and methods for drawing and updating its position, and the animation loop must be put into place.
